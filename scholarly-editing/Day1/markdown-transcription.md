### Brief History of Scholarly editing

### Documentary Editing

### Digital Editing Workflow

If I am interested in creating a digital edition, there are two questions that you must ponder at length before proceeding:

1. What is my text model?

2. What is my workflow?

The answer to (1) will vary quite a bit, depending on your documents, and what kind of edition you would like to produce. We will continue to investigate options to (1) as we move through the course this week.

The answer to (2) is a little more straightforward. Since we are concerned with "digital" editing, we need to think in terms of an appropriate computational pipeline.

### How to transcribe?

And the beginning of the pipeline is the text editor. Many editors have used proprietary word processors to transcribe their editorial material. While that has many virtues (control of type-setting feature, to name one), it presents a lot of problems if you are trying to optimize your workflow. E.g., if you transcribe an edition in Microsoft Word, you would have to transform that document (and all of its attendant features) into XML or HTML in order to work as a digital edition on the Web.
