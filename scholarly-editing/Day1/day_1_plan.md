## Seminar 1: Brief History of Scholarly editing

#### Readings and discussions

A. E. Housman, "The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism"; W. W. Greg, "The Rationale of Copy Text"; Fredson Bowers, "Some Principles..."; D. Greetham, "A History of Textual Scholarship" (from *Cambridge Companion to Textual Scholarship*); Philip Gaskell, Introduction to *From Writer to Reader*.

#### Lecture notes

<p>

* Peisistratus (560–527 BCE) orders the 'official' text of Homer. The primary challenge was to build a coherent text from myriad versions spoken by the rhapsodes. This could be a viable beginning of textual criticism, i.e., being aware of variance and attending to authenticity and authority (whatever those terms mean). (Discuss!)

</p>

* Lycurgus (c. 390–324 BCE) arranges for single texts of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripedes to be deposited into Athenian archives.

* The history of textual editing is a history of arguments about the meaning of terms such as authenticity and authority.

* What is the *textus receptus*? E.g., Falstaff "babbl'd o' green fields" (Shakespeare, *Henry V*); "soiled fish of the sea" (Melville, *White-Jacket*).

* Alexandrian library: manuscript copying; the birth of collation as a practice; dealing with anomalies.

* Descriptive Bibliography.

* Biblical scholarship and philology.

## Seminar 2: Digital Editing Workflow; Brief Introduction to XML

#### Reading
David Birnbaum, ["An even gentler introduction to XML"](http://dh.obdurodon.org/what-is-xml.xhtml).

#### Lecture notes
Digital Editing Workflow

If I am interested in creating a digital edition, there are two questions that you must ponder at length before proceeding:

1. What is my text model, and why am I making it?

2. What is my workflow?

The answer to (1) will vary quite a bit, depending on your documents, and what kind of edition you would like to produce. We will continue to investigate options to (1) as we move through the course this week.

The answer to (2) is a little more straightforward. Since we are concerned with "digital" editing, we need to think in terms of an appropriate computational pipeline.



Transcription Options

 The beginning of the pipeline is the flexible text editor. By flexible I mean an editor that is amenable to Web publishing, and uses non-proprietary open source formatting. Many editors have used proprietary word processors to transcribe their editorial material. While that has many virtues (control of type-setting feature, to name one), it presents a lot of problems if you are trying to optimize your workflow. E.g., if you transcribe an edition in Microsoft Word, you would have to transform that document (and all of its attendant features) into XML or HTML in order to make it work as a digital edition on the Web.

 For us, the common understanding is that XML files should be our edition files of record. Ideally, all documents would be transcribed in XML from the beginning, but for a variety of reasons that is not always practicable.

 First we will look at the most basic of transcription: Markdown. This is lightweight web authoring at its best.
