MS sources for LRBS

Documentary Editing examples:
SLV/28 (Southey letter)
SLV105/24 (GB Shaw letter): short letter
SLV/13 (Emerson letters)
SLV/5 (Burns letter): excellent; it is a letter with a poem text included ('Song of Death').

Literary Editing examples:
SLV/32 (Tennyson, ‘The Voyage of Maeldune’)
SLV/33 (Tennyson, ‘Early Spring’): not that interesting on first blush; has two revisions, but this versions differs from the final text. **Consult Ricks's edition***
SLV/10 (Carlyle’s Prinzenraub): fairly long, but a lot of revisions, also different mediums and hands: ink, pencil, crayon
SLV/6 (Byron, Childe Harold canto). See McGann's Byron, vol. 2: p. 298. Interesting revisions in Cantos 1, 2, 10, 19, 32, 50, 1 [after 54], 56, 67, 68 ('wrong' and 'strong'). Also the extra-textual stuff---letters, notes &c.
SLV/80 (Sassoon’s Georgian Parodies): yes indeed, for its textual uniqueness as against its published uniqueness in Vanity Fair. Minor revisions in a few poems, the most interesting of which are in the D. H. Lawrence parody (some capitalization and lineation differences, and a few substantive revisions).
SLV/27 (Walter Scott): The Death of Laird Jock and A Highland Anecdote: minor revisions.
