# Digital Scholarly Editing, London Rare Books School (2-6 July 2018).

Course tutor: Christopher Ohge, Lecturer in Digital Approaches to Literature (Institute of English Studies, School of Advanced Study, University of London)

## Synopsis

This course surveys the fundamentals of literary editing as well as the technological skills required for producing digital editions. It aims to provide an understanding of editorial theory and practice, including the study of manuscripts, the theory of copy text editing, and the decisions relating to textual and contextual apparatus that inform the design of an edition. Students will focus on encoding documents in XML using the standards of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and the process by which XML documents become digital editions. Students will also learn about HTML markup, CSS, alternative markup languages (such as LMNL), XSLT (for processing XML documents), and how to incorporate digital facsimiles into editions. No prior experience with programming is required.
